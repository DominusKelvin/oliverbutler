## Overview

## What is Strapi

Strapi is an open-source headless CMS written with React and Node.js. By Default Strapi provides the ability to resize a photo to multiple different sizes, to allow for placeholders, thumbnails etc.

Strapi also allows you to override any of the core functions or plugins, this allows us to override any part we want - For example, to add Blurhash integration.

## What is BlurHash

Blurhash takes an image and returns a short string which represents its placeholder. Rather than sending a client a URL of an image placeholder that you may blur, instead you return the placeholder directly in the reply.

This means that rather than a client rendering black boxes whilst waiting for an image to appear, they can instantaneously display a low resolution (but visually appealing) placeholder.

Below we can see an example of using [blurha.sh](https://blurha.sh) to convert an example image to a BlurHash string.

## What we are trying to achieve

Below is the structure of an image within Strapi, what we want to add to each image is the `blurHash` variable. This will allow us to render the BlurHash in our front-end application.

```javascript
{
  "_id": "606ba7fdb8c966001589e29c",
  "name": "strapi-blurhash.jpg",
  "alternativeText": "",
  "caption": "Strapi Logo",
  "hash": "strapi_blurhash_56388c4e39",
  "ext": ".jpg",
  "mime": "image/jpeg",
  "size": 22.49,
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "blurHash": "U6BL~rj^04V}xvj@Rla#02ju~movDsWDx?oc",
  "url": "https://oliverbutler.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/strapi_blurhash_56388c4e39.jpg",
  "formats": {
    ...
  },
  "provider": "aws-s3"
}
```

## How do I do this?

There has been several questions on Stack Overflow regarding how to use Blurhash with Strapi. I managed to find a working solution by overriding the Upload Extension, allowing a custom blurHash field that can be set upon image upload.

### Update the model of a file

We need to add the file`./extensions/upload/models/File.settings.json`. This file contains the default definition of a File, we have added the lines 23-26 for a blurHash string.

```javascript
{
  "info": {
    "name": "file",
    "description": ""
  },
  "options": {
    "timestamps": true
  },
  "attributes": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false,
      "required": true
    },
    "alternativeText": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "caption": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "blurHash": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "width": {
      "type": "integer",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "height": {
      "type": "integer",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "formats": {
      "type": "json",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "hash": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false,
      "required": true
    },
    "ext": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "mime": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false,
      "required": true
    },
    "size": {
      "type": "decimal",
      "configurable": false,
      "required": true
    },
    "url": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false,
      "required": true
    },
    "previewUrl": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "provider": {
      "type": "string",
      "configurable": false,
      "required": true
    },
    "provider_metadata": {
      "type": "json",
      "configurable": false
    },
    "related": {
      "collection": "*",
      "filter": "field",
      "configurable": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Update the Upload Service

We need to add the file`./extensions/upload/services/Upload.js`. The raw file for this can be found at [github.com/strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/e65ad58d2c9a09be9622f8cab5d5f619886d0a8b/packages/strapi-plugin-upload/services/Upload.js#L145).

The specific part of this file we are focussing on is the function `uploadFileAndPersist`. By adding some logic upon the successful creation of a thumbnail preview of this file we can reduce the overhead added by BlurHash as we can process an extremely small image.

The custom code added is between the `BEGIN BLURHASH` and the `END BLURHASH` comments.

```javascript
async uploadFileAndPersist(fileData, { user } = {}) {
  const config = strapi.plugins.upload.config;

  const {
    getDimensions,
    generateThumbnail,
    generateResponsiveFormats,
  } = strapi.plugins.upload.services["image-manipulation"];

  const thumbnailFile = await generateThumbnail(fileData);
  if (thumbnailFile) {
    await strapi.plugins.upload.provider.upload(thumbnailFile);

    // Begin Override

    const encodeImageToBlurhash = (imageBuffer) =>
      new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        sharp(imageBuffer)
          .raw()
          .ensureAlpha()
          .toBuffer((err, buffer, { width, height }) => {
            if (err) return reject(err);
            resolve(
              blurhash.encode(
                new Uint8ClampedArray(buffer),
                width,
                height,
                4,
                4
              )
            );
          });
      });

    const blurHash = await encodeImageToBlurhash(thumbnailFile.buffer);

    // Add a custom field in File.settings.json to add a blurHash
    fileData.blurHash = blurHash;

    // End Override

    await strapi.plugins.upload.provider.upload(fileData);

    delete thumbnailFile.buffer;
    _.set(fileData, "formats.thumbnail", thumbnailFile);
  }
```

## Summary ðŸŽ‰

Upon successfully editing these files, all new images uploaded to Strapi will automatically generate BlurHashes, previous files can either be re-uploaded or you could write a function to loop through all the images within Strapi and generate their Blur Hashes.

If theres anything you think I've missed or you want to discuss this further, contact me.
